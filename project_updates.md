## This is the version where there is no restriction on the TRP-NBR look up. Implying that the tryptophan and its nearest donor neighbor residue, each can be from different chains.

### The only thing we can control is whether we turn on/off restriction on internal hydrogen bonds for the donor residue pair (TRP & NBR). That will change results for all. And that is the only thing remains to be done, in terms of adding felxibilty.

### The result is almost similar as previous version (with chain restriction for TRP-NBR).
### And IMO we can rescue these cases with simulation but that is another direction, and was always a possibile scenario.
